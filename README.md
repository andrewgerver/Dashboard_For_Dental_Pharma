# Dashboard_For_Dental_Pharma
We were given a brief by a company who had collected data on various projects they were completed/had completed around the world in countries they operated in. We were approached as they did not know how to visualise this data in a way they would be able to draw conclusions from. Therefore using Tableau I created an interactive dashboard which allowed the company to track key KPI's they had outlined in an intial meeting. It was important to ensure the dashboard was easy to read and interactive with as it is of paramount importance that the whoever was interacting with it (be it a regional manager or the general manager) was able to do so with ease in order to draw the relevant conclusions. I included filters so that the client would be able to only view information relative to their specific needs, creating an overall more positive and interactive user experience. This was my first attempt at a proffesional dashboard tracking KPI's therefore I understand it is not perfect and there room for improvements, which I have had fedback to me and taken into consideration for the future.
